May 2020Paraphrase Generation with a Bilingual Model and Continuous Embeddings
Master’s Thesis, Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University
Machinated a novel technique for paraphrase generation using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) Loss on a transformer network,
and showed that it produces superior paraphrases as compared to the log-likelihood model by employing bilingual data to
induce zero-shot paraphrasing, guided by Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov .
May 2017 -
July 2017Cognitive Approach to Natural Language Processing
Research Intern, Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
Developed a cognitive text parser that combines syntactic and semantic approaches, to process textual data into cognitive
structural representations, to be used as a feature extractor for downstream NLP tasks, and demonstrated the correlation
of the extracted cognitive features with semantic and syntactic text features, guided by Prof. Veni Madhavan.
