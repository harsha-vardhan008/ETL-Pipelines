PROJECTS  
FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR DRIVERS  2025- Present  
Currently working on an ongoing data science project focused on facial emotion recognition.  
  - The project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify emotions from facial expressions.  
  - Involves the end -to-end process, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
  - The system aims to provide practical applications in fields such as driver behavior analysis, mental health 
monitoring, and enhanced user interaction  
CINEMA BOOKING SYSTEM  2023-24 
Designed a front -end website for a sample application based on a cinema booking system using HTML and CSS, 
meeting basic requirements for user interface design.
